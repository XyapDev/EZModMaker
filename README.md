# EZModMaker

EZModMaker is a program for cyberconnect2 modding
as it's name says it's Easy good thing to start with, or make quick mods (not the best option for making mods as a intermediate modder)
it was made for beginners to learn modding and (maybe) quick mods for any mod creator!


and sometimes it even corrupts the file so don't forget to backup
and it's very buggy like ~~Cyberpunk 2077~~ so don't be surprised if you end up with a cursed mod



## thats all have fun using this ~~Cyberpunk 2077 Clone!~~

### based on ZealotTormunds's Character Manager
